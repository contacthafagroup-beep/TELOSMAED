- ✅ Newsletter: "Browse Articles" links to /articles instead of /magazine
- ✅ All magazine links redirected to articles page

## 📝 What Remains

The word "magazine" still appears in:
- **Metadata descriptions** (SEO) - "Christian magazine" as a descriptor
- **About page** - Historical context about TELOS Digital Magazine
- **Mission statements** - Describing what TELOS MAED is

These are kept because they describe the nature of the publication, not link to magazine pages.

## 🎯 Result

- ❌ No more `/magazine` routes
- ❌ No magazine navigation links
- ❌ No magazine components
- ✅ All links redirect to `/articles`
- ✅ Clean navigation structure

The magazine functionality has been completely removed from the application!
